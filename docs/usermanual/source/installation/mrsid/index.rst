Enabling MrSID image support
============================

The OpenGeo Suite comes with support for publishing data from many formats supported by the `Geospatial Data Abstraction Library <http://gdal.org>`_ (GDAL). These formats include DTED, EHdr, AIG, ENVIHdr, and much more.

`MrSID <http://www.gdal.org/frmt_mrsid.html>`_ is available as an optional extension as well, but due to licensing issues, it is not enabled by default. The steps to enable support will differ depending on how the OpenGeo Suite is installed, and on what platform.

Find the method of installation below and continue there.

.. _installation.mrsid.ubuntu:

Ubuntu
------

.. note:: By default, the Production WARs install will not show **any** of the GDAL image formats at all. To enable GDAL image formats in the Production WAR file, please see the section on :ref:`installation.gdal`. This section assumes that the GDAL image formats are already enabled.

MrSID support is provided by a separate package called **gdal-mrsid**.

#. Install the following package from the OpenGeo repository. (See :ref:`installation.linux.suite` for instructions on how to add the OpenGeo repository)::

      # apt-get install gdal-mrsid

   .. note::  You must run these commands as root or use :command:`sudo`.

#. Restart Tomcat.
