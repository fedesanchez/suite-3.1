Creating a Basic Web Map
========================

There are only a few steps in creating a basic web map with your data using the OpenGeo Suite. This section will guide you through the processâ€”from loading data to a finished map. The following workflow assumes your data is stored as shapefiles, although there are many types of data formats that the OpenGeo Suite can load and publish.

This workflow will use GeoExplorer as the framework for creating and publishing the web map. The data will be saved in a PostGIS database table and published through GeoServer, but all of that will happen automatically through these steps, just by using GeoExplorer.

For more information about GeoExplorer, please see the `reference documentation <../../geoexplorer/>`_.
