.. _geoexplorer.using.query:Query=====The :guilabel:`Query` tool provides options for querying features in the currently selected layer. Features may be queried by attribute or current map extent.To activate the :guilabel:`Query` tool, click :guilabel:`Query` on the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.toolbar`. .. figure:: images/button_query1.png   *Query tool*Once the :guilabel:`Query` tool has been activated, the :guilabel:`Query` and :guilabel:`Table` panels will be displayed below the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel` and :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow` respectively. .. figure:: images/panel_query_tab.png   *Query and table panels*.. note:: You cannot use the :guilabel:`Query` tools to query :guilabel:`Base Maps` layers. If you select a :guilabel:`Base Maps` layer the :guilabel:`Query` panel will close and the Table panel will be cleared of all entries.Query panel-----------By default, both query options, :guilabel:`Query by current map extent` and :guilabel:`Query by attributes`, are enabled.  .. figure:: images/panel_query.png   *Query panel*:guilabel:`Query by current map extent` restricts the query operation to features in the current map extent. Only those features present in the map extent will be evaluated by the query.To remove this restriction and query all features in the currently selected layer, clear the :guilabel:`Query by current map extent` check box.:guilabel:`Query by attributes` provides a query builder for configuring the conditions of the query. The following options are available:.. list-table::     :header-rows: 1     :widths: 30 70     * - Name       - Description     * - Match condition       - Determines what conditions must be met for the query to apply. Options are *any*, *all*, or *none*.     * - Match condition attribute       - Name of the attribute to test in the query     * - Match condition operator       - Search operator. Options are *=*, *<>*, *<*, *>*, *<=*, *>=*, *like* and *between*.     * - Match condition value       - User-defined value the attribute is matched against.. figure:: images/panel_query_builder.png   *Configuring an attribute query*Once the query conditions have been configured, click the :guilabel:`Query` button to execute the query. With both the :guilabel:`Query by current map extent` and :guilabel:`Query by attributes` options selected, any features that are within the current map extent **and** meet the attribute conditions will be selected. The attributes for the selected features are listed in the :ref:`geoexplorer.using.query.table`. To include additional conditions in the query, click the :guilabel:`add condition` button. .. note:: By default, GeoExplorer uses a page setting of 50 for fetching records. This means records are returned from the server in batches of 50. To clear all the current query filters, click the :guilabel:`Cancel` button.To disable the :guilabel:`Query by attributes` option, clear the :guilabel:`Query by attributes` check box... figure:: images/panel_query_disable.png   *Disabling query options*To close the :guilabel:`Query` panel, click the :guilabel:`Query` tool again to deactivate it... _geoexplorer.using.query.table:Table panel------------The :guilabel:`Table` panel lists the attribute information for features in the currently selected layer. Each row in the :guilabel:`Table` panel represents one feature. .. figure:: images/panel_table.png   *Table panel*The :guilabel:`Table` panel provides the following navigation tools to move between the pages of rows:.. list-table::     :header-rows: 1     :widths: 18 30 85       * - Button       - Name       - Description     * - .. image:: images/button_nextpage.png        - Next page       - Show the next page of feature attributes     * - .. image:: images/button_prevpage.png        - Previous page       - Show the previous page of feature attributes     * - .. image:: images/button_firstpage.png        - First page       - Show the first page of feature attributes     * - .. image:: images/button_lastpage.png        - Last page       - Show the last page of feature attributes.. |zoomtofeat| image:: images/button_zoomtofeat.png                      :align: bottom    To zoom to a particular feature listed in the :guilabel:`Table`, right-click the table row and click :guilabel:`Zoom to selected features`. Alternatively, click the :guilabel:`Zoom to selected features` button |zoomtofeat| in the bottom right corner of the :guilabel:`Table` panel.The :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow` will zoom to, and center on, the extent of the selected feature. .. figure:: images/panel_table_zoom.png   *Zooming to the extent of a selected feature*To select more than one row in the :guilabel:`Table` panel, hold down Ctrl while you click the required rows. For any table row(s) selected in the :guilabel:`Table` panel, the corresponding feature(s) will be highlighted in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow`... figure:: images/panel_table_highlight.png   *Highlighting selected features*To close the :guilabel:`Table` panel, click the collapse button along the top frame of the :guilabel:`Table` panel... figure:: images/panel_table_collapse.png   *Closing the Table panel*To re-open the :guilabel:`Table` panel, click the expand button along the bottom frame of the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow`... figure:: images/panel_table_expand.png   *Opening the Table panel*
